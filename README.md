The N8IR is a standalone experimental audiovisual synthesizer and phrase generator. Designed with a simple set of interconnected audio and visual controls and a modular patchbay, the N8IR creates tightly synced audiovisual patterns, powered by a Teensy microcontroller and CMOS logic chips.

Detailed manual and documentation to follow.
